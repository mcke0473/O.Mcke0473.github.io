		<img src="images/outlanderseries.jpg" width="379" height="212" alt="complete book series">

		<p> Outlander by Diana Gabaldon is by far the best book series I have ever read in my entire life. It is jam packed full of history, adventure, trauma, true love and most importantly time travel. </p>

		<p> Claire and Jamie are the fated lovers in this series. Claire accidentally travels through a standing stone circle in 1945 in the Scottish Highlands and ends up in 1743. She stumbles upon the Scots when running from the English army, in particular an English officer called Black Jack Randall who bares a striking resemblance to her husband back in 1945. The Scots take her in as a protection for herself and for them as they believe she could be a spy for the English being English herself. Claire struggles to fit in in the 18th century and continually gets into trouble due to her foul language, her views on men and her healing ability as it was unheard of for women to be doctors in that time. Jamie and herself form a friendship after she heals his injuries from fighting with the English.

In order to protect both Jamie and Claire from Black Jack, Jamie's uncle decides they should be married, reluctantly Claire agrees.
